# Paris-Metro
This GitHub project, developed as part of my Data Structures and Algorithms course assignment, focuses on exploring the Paris subway network using various graph algorithms. The subway graph is constructed from the 'metro.txt' file, where vertices represent stations, and edges denote connections between them. The file specifies the number of vertices (N) and edges (M) at the beginning, followed by N lines defining vertices and their unique numbers and station names. The graph is directed to account for one-way links. The project aims to apply graph algorithms to analyze and navigate the complex subway network in Paris.
